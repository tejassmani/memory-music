        <h2>Accuracy &amp; Response Time Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          This double beeswarm plot shows the distribution of <strong>accuracy</strong> (top) and 
          <strong>response time</strong> (bottom) across two types of music: calming and vexing. 
          Each dot represents a single trial performed by a participant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dots are color-coded by participant ID and grouped by music type.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the top chart, we see how accurate participants were under calming vs. vexing music. 
          On the bottom chart, we visualize how fast they responded in each case.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can <em>hover</em> over participants to highlight their data, or <em>click</em> on a 
          participant to filter the charts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What it reveals:</strong><br/>
          Some participants may be more accurate under calming music but respond faster under vexing music. 
          Others may show the opposite trend. This chart helps identify individual variability in how 
          music affects cognitive control and performance.

        <h2>Mean EDA by Trial</h2>
        <p>
          This line chart tracks the average Electrodermal Activity (EDA) - a common stress indicator - over time across 16 trials. We compare EDA responses during calming music and vexing music sessions.
        </p>
        <p>The purple line shows average EDA under calming music.</p>
        <p>The orange line shows EDA under vexing music.</p>
        <p>The chart updates dynamically based on participant and session type filters.</p>
        <p><strong>What it reveals:</strong><br/>
          Higher EDA typically reflects greater physiological arousal or stress. Here, we can explore whether vexing music consistently elicits higher stress responses or whether calming music helps reduce arousal over time.

        <h2>EDA vs. Accuracy Dashboard</h2>
       <p>
         This interactive scatterplot shows how physiological arousal (mean EDA) relates 
          to cognitive accuracy on each trial, under both calming and vexing music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each point is one trial. Color indicates the music session (<strong>Calming</strong> 
          vs. <strong>Vexing</strong>). Use the <strong>Controls</strong> panel on the right to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Filter by participant <em>Gender</em></li>
          <li>Filter by <em>Task Type</em> (1-back or 3-back)</li>
          <li>Limit to trials ≤ <span id="trial-slider-value-inline">31</span> via the slider</li>
        </ul>
       <p>
          The <strong>X-axis</strong> is mean EDA (μS); the <strong>Y-axis</strong> is trial accuracy (0–100%). 
          Hover a point to see participant, trial number, and exact values.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What it reveals:</strong><br/>
          Explore whether higher arousal correlates with better or worse performance, 
          and how this relationship changes with music type.
