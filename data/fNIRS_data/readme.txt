fNIRS data collected via NIRSport 2 and processed with Nirslab software and stored in “fNIRS data” folder. 

	o The processed total hemoglobin (tothb), oxygenated hemoglobin (ohb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (dohb), and saturated oxygen level (O2) data in millimole (mmol) for each subject collected from 44 channels (channel 1 - 44) are available through folders in CSV format.
 		o data saved as: {Subject number,gender_,type of data (e.g., dohb)}

	o The recording start time is 0 and the sampling frequency is 7.6294 Hz.

	o The channels' configuration is depicted in a PDF file "cahnnel_conf", where the sources are shown by red color and the word "S", and detectors are indicated by the blue colors and the word "D". Also, channel numbers are presented on each channel.

	o The trigger information and sessions timings with respect to onset of fNIRS recording are available in excel files for each subject, and that data is saved as: {"Subject number","gender_Triggers.csv”}.

	o The timing of triggers can be used for the purpose of synchronization with Biopac data.
