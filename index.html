        <h2>Welcome to Music for Memory</h2>
        <p>
          As a student or professional, you've probably had moments where you're
          deep in focus: writing, coding, or cramming with music playing in your
          ears. But have you ever wondered:
          <em
            >Is this music actually helping me concentrate, or making it
            harder?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          That's exactly the question we set out to explore. Using data from
          <em
            >A Multimodal Dataset for Investigating Working Memory in Presence
            of Music</em
          >, we dive into how different types of music,
          <strong>calming</strong> versus <strong>vexing</strong>, affect memory
          accuracy, reaction time, and physiological stress responses during
          cognitive tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the original study, participants completed memory tests (1-back and
          3-back) while researchers recorded behavioral performance alongside
          biometric signals like heart rate and electrodermal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built this tool to make those insights both
          <strong>personal</strong> and <strong>practical</strong>. First, take
          a short quiz to simulate the memory task. You'll see how your own
          performance changes under different musical conditions. Then dive into
          interactive visualizations that compare your results to broader trends
          in the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're studying for finals, writing an essay, or just curious
          about how music affects your brain, Music for Memory helps you answer
          the question we all care about:
          <strong>What kind of music helps me work best?</strong>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>
          Before exploring the data you may have a few questions about the
          terminology used or the premise of the study, we hope to answer those
          here.

        <h3>1. What is calming and vexing music?</h3>
        <p>
          Calming music is characterized by slow tempos, gentle melodies and
          harmonies, and smooth dynamics that lower arousal. Vexing music, by
          contrast, uses faster tempos, louder volumes, dissonance or
          unpredictable rhythms to heighten tension, challenge the listener, or
          increase cognitive and emotional arousal.
        </p>
        <h3>2. What is an n-back memory task?</h3>
        <p>
          An n-back memory task is a continuous working-memory test where you
          view a sequence of items, in our case letters, and must signal
          whenever the current item matches the one presented n steps earlier,
          with higher n increasing the task's difficulty.
