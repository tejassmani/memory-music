      <h2>Project Prototype</h2>
      <h3>What we have done so far :</h3>
      <p>
        In this prototype we have visualized the trial accuracy by condition and
        also the average Electrodermal Activity (EDA) by treatment type, we've
        done this throuhg two interactive charts. We cleaned and processed a
        subset of the behaviroal and biometric data from "A Multimodal Dataset
        for Investigating Working Memory in Presence of Music" from PhysioNet.
        We've made our charts interactive by adding participant and condition
        filters that lets user interact with the chart and explore subsets of
        the data. In the first chart we've boxplots to show the range and
        variability of the data and in the second chart we have the the
        confidence band to show the variability too and when you click a
        specific condition, the y axis is dynamically zoomed into for looking at
        changes at a smaller scale.
      </p>

      <h3>Most challenging part of project to design :</h3>
      <p>
        The greatest challenge will be synchronizing multimodal data (EDA, HR,
        facial expression) with behavioral metrics and managing differing time
        scales and formats. Visually, we aim to design an interface that's
        informative without being overwhelming. One of the most challenging
        parts of this project will be to combine all the different datasets such
        as EDA, heart rate, facial data. Once we combine this data it will still
        be difficult to compare as there are different levels of granularity and
        differetn formats. We also need to keep in mind that we need to have the
        reader engaged through a inviting visual layout and interesting
        interactive visualizations while not overwhelming them with information.
        We will also consider adding hovering tooltips and animations so that
        users can enjoy their experience to the maximum.
