        While many people rely on music to stay focused, there hasn’t been an easy way to see how music impacts performance on an individual level. That’s where our tool comes in. Take our quiz to determine what type of study playlist suits you best, and explore the larger research done to gain a deeper understanding of how music shapes cognitive function.
