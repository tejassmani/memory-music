          Our motivation for creating <strong>Music for Memory</strong> was to
          explore how different types of music—specifically calming versus
          vexing—affect working memory and stress response during cognitive
          tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          While many people rely on music to stay focused, there hasn’t been an
          easy way to see how music impacts performance on an individual level.
          That’s where our tool comes in. Take our quiz to determine what type
          of study playlist suits you best, and explore the larger research done
          to gain a deeper understanding of how music shapes cognitive function.

      <h2>Welcome to Music for Memory</h2>
  <p>
    As a student or professional, you’ve probably had moments where you’re deep in focus—
    writing, coding, or cramming—with music playing in your ears. But have you ever wondered:
    <em>Is this music actually helping me concentrate, or making it harder?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s exactly the question we set out to explore. Using data from
    <em>A Multimodal Dataset for Investigating Working Memory in Presence of Music</em>,
    we dive into how different types of music—<strong>calming</strong> vs. <strong>vexing</strong>—affect
    memory accuracy, reaction time, and physiological stress responses during cognitive tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the original study, participants completed memory tests (1-back and 3-back) while
    researchers recorded behavioral performance alongside biometric signals like heart rate
    and electrodermal activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    We built this tool to make those insights both <strong>personal</strong> and <strong>practical</strong>.
    First, take a short quiz to simulate the memory task—you’ll see how your own performance
    changes under different musical conditions. Then dive into interactive visualizations that
    compare your results to broader trends in the dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you’re studying for finals, writing an essay, or just curious about how music
    affects your brain, Music for Memory helps you answer the question we all care about:
    <strong>What kind of music helps me work best?</strong>
